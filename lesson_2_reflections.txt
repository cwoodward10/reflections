What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

        It creates an empty Git repository. You need to run the command so that
        Git knows that it should starting tracking version.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

        The staging area is different in that it is a separate place that only
        keeps track of things that you expect to or would like to change as opposed
        to everything that exists within the repository. It allows us more control
        what we think are valuable changes and what aren't.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

        You can put only the files you want to change per commit in the staging area.
        That way, even if more files were changed during the time period in question,
        only the ones that you want to commit with this commit are actually committed.
